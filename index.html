    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
          Welcome to my personal website. My name is Hanquan Wang and you can call me John if you like. I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington. 
          I obtained my B.S. degree at the UW in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Mechatronics. My passion lies in control systems and robotic manipulation—fields where I can blend mechanical design, software integration, 
          and precision control to build impactful engineering solutions. I am super intrigued on robot locomotion and bio-inspired adaptability. I am eager to learn from everyone and free feel to reach out using my email or LinkedIn 
          listed on the bottom of the page.

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>

    <p><strong>CAD/Manufacturing Intern — Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</strong><br>
    At PNNL, I contributed to advanced welding and robotic tooling projects. 
    I designed a Friction Stir Tool and a precision test fixture for welding aluminum plates, selecting materials based on mechanical performance. 
    I programmed ABB robots in C++ to perform complex welding tasks across 28 plates, resolving singularities through custom control logic. Additionally, 
    I engineered end effectors for robotic plasma gouging, welding, and grinding—integrating linear bearing blocks to achieve high-accuracy motion. 
    My work also involved researching cold-spray additive manufacturing for improved material durability, supported by cavitation erosion testing. 
    I led overall process development and ensured smooth execution and control across various fabrication workflows.</p>

    <p><strong>Mechanical Engineer — AUTEV</strong><br>
    At AUTEV, I led the design and rapid prototyping of a robotic end effector for EV charging, which was successfully tested in the field within three weeks. 
    I designed a charge head holder from coated aluminum to reduce weight and resist corrosion in outdoor environments. 
    I also programmed motion paths for a UF xARM robotic arm using Python, optimizing movement precision and efficiency for automated charging tasks.</p>

    <p><strong>Mechanical Sub-Lead — Superbike (UW Team)</strong><br>
    As the mechanical sub-lead for the UW Superbike team, I led the research, design, and manufacturing of a custom motorcycle swingarm inspired by the Honda CBR600RR. 
    I incorporated Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFM/DFA) principles, used GD&T for machining accuracy, 
    and performed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to ensure structural integrity under load. I also led the hands-on fabrication phase, 
    completing welding and tube bending to finish assembly in less than a month.</p>

    <h2>Research Experience</h2>

    <p><strong>Research Engineer — NASA Cryogenic Vortex Generator (UW APL)</strong><br>
    At the UW Applied Physics Lab, I’m investigating vortex generator designs for cryogenic pipe systems under NASA funding. 
    The goal is to improve thermal transfer by disrupting the Leidenfrost vapor barrier in cryogenic environments. 
    I analyze various flow disruption geometries to balance reduced boil-off with minimal pressure drop, contributing to more efficient rocket fuel systems.</p>

    <p><strong>Research Assistant — UW Fluids Lab</strong><br>
    In this lab, I developed a magnet-controlled particle releaser with eight compartments to support experimental studies of flow dynamics. 
    I integrated camera and laser tracking to monitor over 125 experimental runs and processed velocity field data using MATLAB and PIVmat. 
    My system allowed for controlled fluid releases, enabling precise Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) analysis.</p>

    <p><strong>Mechanical/Technical Writing Lead — UW SEAL</strong><br>
    At UW SEAL, I led a six-person writing team in preparing and submitting a National Science Foundation (NSF) proposal ahead of schedule. 
    My technical work focused on designing a novel electrode mask to improve filtration performance by 5% while lowering production cost. 
    I performed analytical calculations to fine-tune the design, achieving an estimated 80% filtration efficiency.</p>

    <p><strong>Research Assistant — UW QUIVER Lab</strong><br>
    In the QUIVER lab, I worked on improving robotic-assisted surgical systems. 
    I designed and 3D-printed a housing for motor and vibrator components that improved the implantation process’s efficiency. 
    I also developed a mobile UI using MIT App Inventor and integrated real-time data collection through Arduino programming. 
    I completed this full prototype cycle—from design to testing—within a five-week timeline.</p>
